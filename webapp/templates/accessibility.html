            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Accessibility Checks</h2>
            <br />
            While developing the frontend of the web application, I aimed to keep responsiveness and accessibility in mind.
            I referred to W3C's accessibility resources and checked my code against <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/" class="text-fg-brand underline hover:no-underline">this list</a> as detailed below.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Page Titles</h3>
            <br />
            I ensured that each page has a title that adequately distinguishes the page from other pages.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Image Text Alternatives</h3>
            <br />
            After adding images to web pages, I ensured that each image had appropriate and functional alt text for those who cannot see the image.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Headings</h3>
            <br />
            While developing each page, I was not adding headings but using bold text as a substitute instead. Later I replaced the bold text accordingly with headings.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Contrast Ratio</h3>
            <br />
            Initially, each page was using a gray text but later on I changed all text to use black text for better contrast on a white background.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Resize Text</h3>
            <br />
            When zooming in on pages, the text size increases as expected without any issues.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Keyboard Access and Visual Focus</h3>
            <br />
            On the credit card approval form, keyboard navigation is supported. Links on pages are also highlighted appropriately when hovered over.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Forms, Labels, and Errors</h3>
            <br />
            Every form control has a label associated with it, and labels are positioned correctly.
            Error handling is supported when incorrect inputs are entered and also if inputs are left empty.
